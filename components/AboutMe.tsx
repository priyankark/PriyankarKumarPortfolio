            In the past, I have worked in the Conversational AI space - building voice apps both independently and for various clients and startups. Some of my voice apps (Alexa Skills) were winners in various monthly competitions and hackathons organized by Amazon at the time.

            Beyond my day-to-day responsibilities, I love working on side projects and participating in hackathons, and have even been a winner at quite a few of them! You can check some of my side projects out below. I also like teaching what I know about programming and have been a part of various volunteering initiatives both inside and outside of Microsoft.
