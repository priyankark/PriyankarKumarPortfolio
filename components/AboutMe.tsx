        <p>
        I currently work as a software engineer at Microsoft in the CSX team (Commercial Sales Experience). 
        As a full-stack developer, I get to dabble with a variety of technologies in front-end, back-end as well as data engineering. 
        This includes React, Typescript, ASP.NET, a lot of Azure services, node.js and many other cool stuff! I have also had extensive experience in building voice apps for Alexa in the past!
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
        On the education front, I have a Bachelor's in Computer Science from Manipal Institute of Technology, India with a minor specialization in Big Data.  
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
            I enjoy everything software and computer science. I have also been a partcipant and winner in a lot of hackathons! I also love working on side projects (check 'em out below!)
